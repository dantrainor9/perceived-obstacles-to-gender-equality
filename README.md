# perceived-obstacles-to-gender-equality
#This project was completed as part of a Makeover Monday challenge. This graph is intended to give an overview look of what people perceive as the greatest barrier to gender equality around the world, based on survey data gathered in 2021. Countries are represented by hue, while responses are listed on the x axis and % of respondents on the y axis. The prompt question is as follows: "Thinking about the list of reasons below, which, if any, do you personally think are the main reasons why women may not be equal to men in your country?" Responses have been paraphrased for graph readability.
